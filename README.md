🚀 Project Update: Real-Time Face & Emotion Detection System 🎯

I built a real-time face and emotion detection system using Python and OpenCV, extending traditional face detection by adding emotion recognition from live webcam input.

🔍 What the system does

Detects human faces in real time using Haar Cascade

Analyzes facial expressions to identify emotions

Draws bounding boxes and emotion labels on detected faces

Runs smoothly on a live webcam feed

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

OpenCV (cv2)

Haar Cascade Classifier

Emotion Detection Model

🧠 Key Learnings

Real-time image processing with OpenCV

Face detection vs emotion classification

Working with pre-trained computer vision models

Handling live video streams efficiently

📌 This project helped me strengthen my understanding of computer vision fundamentals and how AI models work with real-time data.
